# calculator

## Thoughts before starting

Well, I kinda jumped the gun on this one, haha, got started before I even cloned the repo on my local virtual machine (did I use that right? Repo, I mean, I'm still not used to a lot of this lingo), anyway; I really don't have any sort of expectations when it comes to this project, I'm not worryng about the code right now as per the recommendation of the assignment instructions; just worrying about having a visually appealing calculator.
To be fair, I don't think I will do a good job at making things visually appealing any time soon though, one thing that I DEFINITELY need to get is one of them basic graphic design courses from Coursera, or maybe a skillshare subscription? 

That's unimportant right now. I honestly think that this one is going to give me trouble, but there's an off chance that it doesn't? Since some of the previous excercises from last chapter were a breeze to work through; I'm cautiously optimistic, would be the correct way to say how I'm feeling.
